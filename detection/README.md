## Python

All files in `third_party` directory were taken from public GitHub repositories of 
[courao/ocr.pytorch](https://github.com/courao/ocr.pytorch) and
[opconty/pytorch_ctpn](https://github.com/opconty/pytorch_ctpn).
Files in `third_party` were refactored to contain only necessary code for this project and code style was altered.
Training was not executed by me, pretrained weights were downloaded for CTPN model from
